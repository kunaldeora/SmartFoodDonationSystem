# SmartFoodDonationSystem

Problem Statement
In order to solve the above mentioned issue and to serve for the betterment of the society, I am planning to make a Smart Food Donation application which will provide food to the needy person under one single roof. The left-over food can be gathered from either a person’s house or from a restaurant. In the donor’s refrigerator a sensor will be installed which will identify the spoilage of the food by its odor or by the visual view of the food. It can also consider expiry date mentioned on the barcode of food item. Using this information, owner of the refrigerator will be informed some days prior to the expiry by the application. If the owner agrees to donate, then a dedicated team for the owner’s locality will come to pick up the food and will deliver it to Food Standard Authority. After checking the food quality it will be send to Food Distribution Authority who will deliver the food to the warehouse in the area from which the food has been collected. If the food does not match the eating standard then Waste Management Authority will collect the food and will recycle it. Once the standardized food arrives in warehouse, it can be served to the needful and homeless people.
In order to lure people and restaurants to donate food, a dollar price and tax redemption will be given to the food donor and restaurant respectively every year depending upon the donation quantity and frequency. This will not only motivate people to donate food but will also help society to improve.

Key Entities
This application will involve communication between enterprises such as Food Collection Agency, Food Standard Agency, Food Distribution Agency and Waste Management Agency. These agencies will include roles such as administrator, food collector, food distributor, citizen, commercial body and waste collector role.

Key Issues
The key issues targeted to resolve in this application are as follows:
•	Needy and homeless people will get good food to eat.
•	There will be proper utilization of the waste food in the city.
•	People will be start contributing for the betterment of the society.
•	US government spends more than 1 billion dollars just to dispose food waste. This application will reduce this amount by a significant number.
